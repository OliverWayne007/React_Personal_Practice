---> origin = protocol + host + port

---> path/route can be different

Example: 

1. https://www.website.com:3000/users   2. https://www.website.com:3000/products

Both of these urls have the same origin because they have the same:

protocol : https , host : www.website.com , port : 3000

---> path/route can be different: path/route (1) : /users , path/route (2) : /products 

---> If a request is made for a resource from one origin to a different origin, these requests are called Cross-Origin-Requests
     and it comes under Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS).

---> The browser by default blocks any Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing for security reasons.

---> If CORS is not explicitly enabled, the browser shows the following error message:

Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:3000/' from origin 'http://localhost:1234' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

Preflight request is a request that a browser sends to the server before the actual request to find out if the actual request 
to be sent by the browser to the server is allowed or not.

---> For sending a preflight request, the HTTP method "OPTIONS" is used.

Browser classifies HTTP requests into 2 types:
1. Simple Request 
2. Non-Simple Request

1. Simple Requests: Requests that do bot require a Preflight request to be sent by the browser.
2. Non-Simple Requests: Requests that require a Preflight request to be sent by the browser.
